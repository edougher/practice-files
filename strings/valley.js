/*
A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.

Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

    Example

 steps = 8
 path = 'DDUUUUDD'

The hiker first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain 2 units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.

    Function Description

countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

int steps: the number of steps on the hike
string path: a string describing the path

    Returns

int: the number of valleys traversed
